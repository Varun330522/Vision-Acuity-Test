Vision Acuity Test using VR
This Unity project is a Vision Acuity Test application that utilizes Virtual Reality (VR) technology. It provides three different tests to assess Vision Acuity, 
Stereopsis, and Colorblindness. The application is built using the Unity game engine for android devices .It also has Gaze Pointer so it dont need controller.

Features
Vision Acuity Test: This test measures the clarity of the participant's vision by presenting various visual acuity charts, using Snellen charts. Participants need to identify the symbols or letters correctly to determine their visual acuity.

Stereopsis Test: This test evaluates the participant's depth perception or ability to perceive three-dimensional depth. It presents stereograms or random-dot stereograms, and participants are required to identify objects or patterns with depth.

Colorblindness Test: This test assesses the participant's ability to perceive and differentiate colors accurately. It includes various color-based tasks or Ishihara tests to identify colorblindness or specific color deficiencies.

Requirements
Unity 3D: This project requires Unity version X.X or above. You can download Unity from here.

VR Device: The application supports VR devices such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Ensure that you have the necessary hardware and drivers to run VR applications.

Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open Unity and navigate to the project folder.

Open the Unity project by selecting the project folder in Unity's Open Project dialog.

Once the project is open, ensure that you have the appropriate VR settings configured in Unity. Check Unity's documentation for VR setup instructions specific to your VR device.

Set up the necessary VR scene and assets according to your requirements.

Run the application in the Unity editor or build the project for your target platform and deploy it on your VR device.

Usage
Launch the Vision Acuity Test application on your VR device.

Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the tests and instructions for each test type (Vision Acuity, Stereopsis, Colorblindness).

Perform the tests according to the given instructions. Provide responses or selections based on the displayed stimuli or patterns.

The application will provide feedback or results based on the participant's performance in each test.
